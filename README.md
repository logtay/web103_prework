## Notes

I had never used Picocss before this project, so that was the most difficult part for me. I am used to regular CSS so it was a bit of a jump, but once I got the hang of it, it felt a lot more streamlined. There is still a lot more of Picocss that I would like to explore, but it was interesting balancing the CSS I am used to with Picocss. It was also very hard to get my gif under an acceptable limit.
